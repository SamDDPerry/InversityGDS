FIRST MODEL- I used claude ai to create a basic model of a website that looked like GOV.UK.
it had a few very basic features however very few of them worked and the appearance of it was very user unfriendly and as my main problem I wanted to solve was the user unfriendlyiness.
in order to solve this problem I claude ai to make the appearance of the website more visually appleaing so it would solve my main reseached problem, this became my secnd model.
in respone to this it grouped the information and links into different boxes with emojis and title to indicate the different information that each bubble contained.
at this point i had managed to accomplish my first goal on my MOSCOW analysis which was to arrange the contents of the data in a much more visually appealing way, however not all of the features of the website were functional. This was because the website had no database to lead the user to when the buttons were clicked or to search for when using the search bar.

The first problem i set out to solve was the non functioning search bar, my reasoning for this was even though it was only in my could have section in my MOSCOW analysis when the user opened the website it will be one of the first things they see so i wanted to make sure that it was functional to decrease any chance of user frustration.
to make it worked I asked claude ai to link it to wikepedia so that it will search that database if used allowing the user to access for any questions they might have on definitions or purposes of certain things on the website. Not only that it will alow the user to fine any official government files that they nned to see which are not present of the GOV.UK website or my version of it.

the next issue I solved in my website was something that was in my must have section as it was the main purpose of my project wich was making the acess of driving license services much easier and simpler and the idea that i came up with during my design phase of the project was making a button that would transport the user to a different page of the website with all the services present.
the first process I tried for this would be the "view all driving services" button taking the user to a different website location containg all these features but despite my trying this would not work and it would be a very long and thankless task that would take much more code than a simpler solution that after some self and user testing by Jack daniels I decided would be better.
That solution was just adding another page onto the current website and when the "view all driving services" button is pressed it smooth scrolls the user to that new page 
With the transport to the new page decided the next job was desiging it. I followed the same lay out as the home page with the different boxes containing links and additionally at the bottom of the page i added a new boxes which had tips for drivers since many usesers would be applying for their first license and may appreciate some tips on where to start, that was a feature I got from my could have section

the final stage at that moment of time was to make all of the relavent links work and for order for them to i had to decide on where the would take the user and i thought it would be a good idea for it to take them to the relavent pages of GOV.UK as that would allow the user to do things such as renew their license since things like that are not possible from my website.
I only dis this for the links related to driving however as I had set out with this as the main aspect my website to be that.
so after I had made the links take the user to the correct GOV.UK page for each one i had accomplished all my must have goals and some of my optional ones aswell and it was time to begin the final stage of user testing

the first person I had test my website was jack daniels and from that he said that the website was very user friendly but advised me to make it known that some of the features that I had not finished say coming soon to let the user know they are not complete.
the next people i got to test my website were my parents who i thought would off a good change in perspective as they have been driving for years.
they were able to navigate around my website with almost no issues.
they said a different colour could possibly be used to make the front of the website stand out more.
the final user i tested was my friend who is currently lesrning to drive and had formally complained about the website claiming it was boring
he comented on my website saying that he thought that it was much easier to navigate than the original website and that it was much more informative aswell
when asked if there was anything negative with the website that he would change to do with the presentation and design of it he said no, this was the most important part of my research i believe as it was the closest thing to a proper user i had and so when he was able to navigate it without any issue it showed that my website was in a good spot
